## Asynchronous vs Synchronous Programming

Because async is multi-threaded, operations or programs can be run concurrently. Only one activity or program will be running at a time because Sync is single-threaded. Since async is non-blocking, it will send several requests to the server. Sync is blocking; it will send the server a single request at a time and wait for the server to respond.

## Event-Driven Programming

The execution of a program is controlled by new user events (mouse clicks, key inputs), sensor outputs, or message passing from other programs in event-driven programming. A click event listener that watches a button with a specific id to perform a specific function is present in this program. For illustration, "Tambah Task"
